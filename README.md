# RainfallSimulator
This is a short investigation about the better way to walk in the rain.

The investigation is done in two parts:
1. Creating a simplistic mathematical model,
2. testing the mathematical model against some simulated data.

This was just a short, personal, project and is no basis for professional research.
Hope you find it interesting, or maybe find something useful

Peace :)
